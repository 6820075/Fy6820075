      Many new methods of harvesting electrical energy have been discovered.
      Triboelectric nanogenerators could be the small, cheap solution to find 
      sustainable replacements to power sources that harm the worlds environment. 
      Triboelectric nanogenerators have the capability to be used in many areas, 
      for example in clothes in soles of shoes and on human joints. This article 
      explains the process of the creation of electric energy and how much energy 
      a Triboelectric nanogenerator can produce. It also explores, how human activity
      could easily play such a big role in creating green energy.

      Triboelectric nanogenerators could be the solution to harvesting sustainable
      electrical energy from human activity. Some of the most powerful versions
      of the triboelectric nanogenerators that have been made are so small they 
      can sit between two fingers. This size allows the triboelectric nanogenerators
      to fit and work in almost any situation you could imagine. Alongside their nano
      size they are also relatively low cost to manufacture and have a high efficiency 
      conversion rate.
      
      The process used by triboelectric nanogenerators is that of transforming a 
      mechanical force into electrical energy. The question is how can you harvest 
      the mechanical energy required?

      One way is to use the movement of different areas of the human body. As the joints
      in the human body contract and move apart, it creates a mechanical movement that
      the triboelectronic nanogenerators can harvest and produce electrical energy from
      <a href="#Nasimul Alam S">(Nasimul Alam S,2023)</a>. Different locations in the human body can produce small
      amounts of power in watts, as shown in Fig 1, Fig 2 shows the comparison of 
      what energy different electronic devices need to be powered.

      Another process is the compression of two materials. As materials compress, they 
      create a frictional force between them and when decompressed that frictional force
      creates and flow of electrons within the two materials. For example, sometimes
      when a person takes a jumper off and it rubs over their hair, they may recieve 
      a small electric shock. That flow of electrons created from the decompression
      of frictional force can be harvested by the triboelectric nanogenerators 
      and turned into electrical energy.

      Many people track their steps for health benefits so why not also track your 
      steps producing electrical energy at the same time. Triboelectric nanogenerators 
      could be placed into the soles of running shoes, the compression process of the 
      foot pressing against the floor on every step would produce friction. This 
      is an example of the mechanical energy needed for the transfer to electrical 
      energy in the nanogenerator. The triboelectric nanogenerators could also be
      incorporated into clothing used for exercise and other human activities. The 
      tyoes of fabrics that come into contact with the body under mechanical force 
      and hence produce the electrical energy are made of common textile materials
      such as polyester, cotton and wool. These materials are cheap and can be sewn 
      into different clothes, for example socks.

    <p>
      A professor at Georgia Institute of Technology has reported that a square meter 
      of single layered material can now produce as much as 300 watts <a href="#Toon J">(Toon J,2013)</a>

      On average a man takes around 55,000 steps whilst completing a marathon and a 
      women takes around 62,000 <a href="#Lindsay J">(Lindsay J, 2018)</a>. One square meter of triboelectric 
      nanogenerator produces about 300 watts so if you had one centimeter squared
      of triboelectric nanogenerators they would produce around 0.003 watts. By 
      placing one centimeter squared of triboelectric nanogenerators in the running
      shoes of all the people who took part in the London marathon in 2023 which was
      around 48,000 people <a href="#Lee S">(Lee S, 2023)</a>, then the males would apporximately produce
      1650 watts each and the women would approximately produce 1860 watts each.
      Assuming an equal split of males and females, the number of watts harvested 
      from the triboelectric nanogenerators could  have reached up to 84 million watts.

      In comparison, in 2022 the average number of sunlight hours per day was 4.9 hours
      <a href="#Burgueno Salas E">(Burgueno Salas E, 2023)</a>, which equates to nearly 1800 sunlight hours in the 
      whole of 2022. An average solar panel produces aproximately 400 watts per 
      sunlight hour <a href="#YES Energy Solutions">(YES Energy Solutions, 2023)</a>. In order to produce the theoretical
      84 million watts produced by the triboelectric nanogenerators you would therefore
      need to have just under 120 solar panels working for the whole year.

    <h3 <a id="Conclusion"><b>Conclusion</b> </h3>
    <p>
      Normal every day human activity, when combined with triboelectric nanogenerators,
      could play a large role in shaping the future or harvesting electrical energy 
      in a sustainable environmentally friendly way. With minimal intervention to human
      life strides could be made forward in the development of green energy. The 
      comparison of triboelectric nanogenerators with solar panels as shown above 
      demonstrates just how important this change could be for harvesting electrical energy.
      With triboelectric nanogenerators being recently new forms of technology for producing 
      electrical energy, they have many ways they still could be improved. In the future as
      triboelectric nanogenerators develop even further than they already have, we could 
      see a huge increase in people keeping healthy if human activity and fitness can 
      be joint with producing electrical energy, from mechanical movements such as running. 
      This would be an improvement for human activites and using this would therefore be 
      used to harvest more electrical energy.
